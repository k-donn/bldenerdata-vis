# Blender OpenData visualization

This app compares two devices used for [Blender Benchmark](https://opendata.blender.org/).

A Combo Chart is shown in the browser and the data is uploaded to the user's google sheets for more analysis.

## Running

1.  `npm install`
2.  `node index.js`

## Meta

The license for my code is [LICENSE](./LICENSE).

The license for the Blender data is [LICENSE.txt](./LICENSE.txt)

## TODO

-   Device name autocomplete
-   Device name validation
-   Move data locally instead of querying Blender
