# Blender OpenData visualization

This app compares two devices used for [Blender Benchmark](https://opendata.blender.org/).

A Combo Chart is shown in the browser and the data is uploaded to the user's google sheets for more analysis.

## Running

1.  `npm install`
2.  `node index.js`

## Meta

The license for the Blender data is [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/public-domain/cc0/)

## TODO

-   Device name autocomplete
-   Device name validation
-   Move data locally instead of querying Blender
