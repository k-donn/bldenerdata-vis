# Blender OpenData visualization

This app compares two devices used for [Blender Benchmark](https://opendata.blender.org/).

Input the device names into the field and a visualization appears showing the render times for scenes for each device.

## Running

1.  `npm install`
2.  `node index.js`

## TODO

-   Query data locally instead of querying Blender
